gcc -shared obj.o -o lib.so #make a shared lib
ar cr lib.a obj.o #to make static lib

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home... #to add shared lib directory

gcc main.o -Lpath -llib #main.o should be situated left from added library

#shared and static libs compile exactly the same way with gcc
#the difference is that shared lib could be situated anywhere
#also obj.o should be compiled with -fPIC flag for the shared lib
